# cursor-prompt

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a **dashboard for managing Docker containers**.  
The dashboard is designed to help operators monitor and control containers efficiently and intuitively.  
Development should emphasize consistent structure, clear purpose, and ease of maintenance.

## Workflow
- The user follows a **Vibe Coding** approach, expanding features and structure naturally and intuitively rather than with rigid upfront design.
- **All technical decisions, structural organization, file composition, and documentation responsibilities are delegated to Cursor.**
- Cursor must continuously analyze code, folder structure, naming conventions, and `README.md` files to maintain accurate context and technical coherence.

## Technical Understanding & Responsibility
- Cursor is required to **fully understand all technical details** and reflect them precisely in its suggestions and generated content.
- The user only defines the *what* and the *why*. Cursor is responsible for the *how* — including implementation, structure, and documentation.
- Cursor must execute code and documentation creation directly, ensuring everything remains consistent, understandable, and maintainable over time.

## README & Folder Structure Management
- **Every directory must contain a `README.md`**, and Cursor is responsible for creating and updating it.
- The `README.md` should include:
  - The purpose and role of the folder and its files
  - Criteria and structure for file organization
  - Rules or conventions for adding new files and subdirectories

- When Cursor creates a new file or folder:
  1. If `README.md` does not exist, Cursor must generate it.
  2. If `README.md` already exists, Cursor must review and update it to reflect the new file.
  3. The `README.md` must always represent the current, accurate structure and purpose of the directory — and **Cursor is responsible for maintaining that**.

## Code Authoring Guidelines
- Cursor must analyze the existing codebase for patterns and follow the **same style, flow, and organizational structure**.
- Code should be clear, intention-driven, and easy to interpret. Prioritize explicit clarity over abstraction.
- Comments should focus on *why* a decision was made — not just *what* the code is doing.
- Cursor should be able to answer the following questions at all times:
  - What is this file for?
  - Why was this structure needed?
  - How does this connect with the existing structure?
  - What rule or convention dictated this location or implementation?

## On File Creation
Whenever Cursor creates a new file, it must:
  1. Review the current directory's `README.md` to understand existing structural rules.
  2. Name and organize the file according to those rules.
  3. **Directly update the `README.md`** to include the new file's purpose and how it fits in.
  4. Ensure that the `README.md` remains consistent and accurately reflects the state of the directory.

## Summary
In this project, **Cursor is not a passive assistant, but the primary executor** of structure, implementation, and documentation.  
The user provides goals and direction — **Cursor is fully responsible for all technical execution and structural integrity**.
